# Analysis to Determine the Best Return for Real Estate
Group-1.
## Model Evaluation Strategy

In this branch you will find the notebook [LinearRegressionAnalysis](https://github.com/hixtape1212/Group1Capstone/blob/Gerardo/LinearRegressionAnalysis.ipynb) where we trained four models with different techniques:

* Linear regression
* Desicion tree
* Random forest
* XGBoost

We evaluated each one and we only presented two of them to the stakeholders:

* the worst: Linear regression
* the best: XGBoost

Best regards,
Gerardo
