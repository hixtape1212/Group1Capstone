## See Through the Ambiguity - Predicting Home Prices
Group-1 Consulting has been approached by a real estate investement agency who is requesting an algorithm that predicts home prices. The real estate investment firm FlatTech RealEstate, buys homes in the Austin area. They have tasked our team with finding a datafile, clean it, and run various algorithms to create an home price predictor. Our algorith will predict home prices based on common features of home listings like number of beds, baths, lot size, square footage, etc. to help both buyers and sellers see through the ambiguity in home pricing.

# Business Understanding
Home prices in the U.S. particullary in fast growing cities are important to know for both buyers and sellers, and sometimes the fair market value of a home can be influenced by outside factors, emotional views, and other points that could inflate or deflate the price of a home. Add to that the usually it can cost anywhere from $200 - $600 to appraise a home, machine learning is a great alternative to take some of the ambiguity and time-consuimption out of home pricing. An algorithm such as the one our group has developed can aleviate the risk of buying homes in voliatile markets, letting our clients know a relative value of the home they are buying, helping them to know whether or not they are getting a good deal. 

# Data Understanding
When looking for data, our team was looking for complete datasets on individual home prices, perhaps with an address as a primary key, with the relevant features that most home owners look for when buying a home. These were mentioned above but include number of beds, baths, lot size, and square footage. Other features would be an added bonus, but at the core we wanted data that you would find on a typical home listing.

Searching through Kaggle, our team was able to find the Austin, TX House Listing Dataset by Eric Pierce. He created the dataset for his capstone project in college in 2021. The data was scrapped from Zillow at the time, and he originally wanted to use both images and house features to predict home prices. It was very clean, having over 15,000 listings with 40+ features of each entry. Also a huge plus was that there were no NaN, which made the initial data cleaning part very simple.
